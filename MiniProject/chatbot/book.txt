Preface

At present, the area under
grape cultivation in India is about
111,000 ha (NHB Stat 2011) with
the production in the range of
about 12,35,000 tonnes. Table
grape cultivation is mainly
concentrated in peninsular Indian
states such as Maharashtra,
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and
Andhra Pradesh. Grape is
emerging as an important
commercial fruit crop of India and
the highest among fruit crops in
earning foreign exchange. Further,
it is receiving importance in
creating jobs on and off the farm
and other related sectors, thus
improving economic status of
farmers, farm labourers and other
labourers.

Table grapes are mainly used
for the fresh consumption of
domestic market and very little
(about 2 9%) for export market
mainly for Europe, Middle East,
South East countries and
Bangladesh. A big chunk of table
grapes (> 30 %) are also used for
making raisins. Considering the
end use of grapes, Good
Agricultural Practices (GAP) in
terms of training, pruning,
thinning, fertigation, irrigation,
crop protection and appropriate
method and stage of fruit for
harvesting are important and
therefore these practices in farm

production and post-production
processes have bearing for safe
and healthy grapes for consumers
while taking into account
environmental sustainability. In
this document, all these practices
including selection of appropriate
table grape varieties, the use of
label claim chemicals for quality
and safe end product are covered
for the guidance of all stake
holders particularly, growers,
raisin makers and exporters
keeping in view the food safety
measures in the country and also
for export market. The grape
growers of India are highly
dedicated and committed group,
and are ready to make a mark in
the world grape trade. It is mainly
through their efforts that grape
cultivation has slowly emerged
from the unorganized to an
organized sector. Not only the elite
groups of grower- exporters but a
large number of smaller growers,
too, have become aware of the
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).

I hope all the stake holders in
grape Industry will take advantage
all the guidelines set in this
document and comply with these
requirements for quality
production as required under the
good viticulture practices. 1 also
take this opportunity to thank all
my fellow Scientists, technicians
and others in bringing out this
useful document for the benefit of
grape Industry.

Major table grape
varieties

G. S. KARIBASAPPA

Table grapes are those grapes
which are meant for consumption
while they are fresh, in contrast with
the grapes grown for wine production,
juice production or for drying into
raisins. They should have attractive
appearance, bold and elongated
berries, and crisp pulp with thin and
soft skin. Seedlessness is another
desirable character for these grapes.
The table grape varieties generally
have lower sugar content as compared
to wine grapes and are pulpier. The
salient features of the major grapevine
varieties grown for table purpose in
India are described in this chapter.

1. Thompson Seedless and
its clones

Worldwide, it is the major table
grape variety. In India, it is being
cultivated commercially for about last
five decades. Thompson Seedless
along with its clones have been
successfully cultivated for table as
well as for raisin making and
presently occupy 70 per cent area
approximately of the total 1.12 lakh
hectares under grape cultivation in
the country during 2011-12. Fruit
yields of 20 tons of quality grapes per
hectare can be obtained with this
variety. Under peninsular Indian
conditions the fruit is normally
harvested after 120-150 days of
forward pruning. The berries continue
to ripen even in warm summer days
and these cultivars are suited for
staggered production. Some of the
clonal selections from Thompson
Seedless like Tas-A-Ganesh and

Fig. 1. Thompson Seedless

Sonaka from India, 2A clone from
California, H-5 from Australia have
become popular in India. Manik
Chaman, Maruti Seedless, Ambe
Seedless from India is also gaining
popularity due to their high and
distinctive responses to hormonal
treatments and higher recovery of
export quality fruits.

Salient features

Clusters are medium to large,
cylindrical to conical shaped, heavily
shouldered that ripen in about 130-
140 days after pruning. The berries
are seedless, small to medium sized,
oval to ellipsoidal in shape, soft berry
skin and greenish white to golden in
colour with firm, juicy pulp. The
majority of exported grapes from India
consist of this variety.

2. Manjri Naveen

It is a clonal selection from
Centennial Seedless made at NRCG,
Pune and was released in December,
20009.

Salient features:

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 1
This variety ripens about 25
days early as compared to Thompson
Seedless. It is a white seedless,
naturally bold berry with mild muscat
flavour table grape variety. It has
uniform berries and clusters and do

not require extensive thinning
operations. Extended harvesting
should be avoided, the ripe berries are
less acidic and aromatic hence should
be quickly packed for precooling and
cold storage. Yield of 20-25 tons of
exportable quality fruits can be
obtained per hectare.

3. Red Globe

This variety developed at UC
Davis, California, USA was introduced
to India in 1985 and after multi-
locational evaluation it was
recommended for cultivation.

Salient features

Clusters are big, berries very
bold (22-25 mm dia), red round,
seeded with meaty pulp. It is a late
ripening variety and takes more than
135 days from pruning. It has good
keeping qualities and can be cold
stored for at least 3 months. Fruit
yield is about 20-25 tons per hectare.

4. Fantasy Seedless

It is a complex hybrid derived
from a cross between B36-27xP64-18
at USDA Fresno, California.

Salient features:

Vines are vigorous require high
sunlight exposure for adequate
fruitfulness. This variety does not
require GAs for thinning/ sizing. Some

Fig. 4. Fantasy Seedless

2 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
clusters may require a manual
thinning in rare case. Berries are
medium bold, deep purple to black,
seedless, thin skin and firm and
obovate in shape. Clusters are
medium in size, conical shape, and
medium to loose in compactness with
excellent flavour. It is mid late
ripening variety and takes not less
than 130 days from pruning. Late
harvesting and excess soil moisture
/humid conditions sometimes lead to
berry cracking. Care must be taken
not to over crop during first year of
production. The fruits can be cold
stored for 8 weeks.

5. Flame Seedless

Fig. 5. Flame Seedless

It was obtained as a result of
complex 3 generation hybridization
made at USDA, Fresno, California,
USA.

Salient features:

The vines are very vigorous and
the shoots tend to grow continuously
under tropical conditions. The berries
are bright red, large to medium in
size, round and seedless. They have

crisp skin, firm but juicy pulp with a
distinctive muscat flavour. Bunches
are medium to large, conical and well
filled. It is an early variety and takes
about 95-110 days to harvest from
pruning. Therefore, it is advantageous
to grow in northern states where
grape growing period for fruit
production is less as compared to
southern peninsular states. For
maturity, minimum 16° brix is
required. Ripening should coincide
with slight cool climate for uniform
colour and muscat flavour retention,
i.e., during late February or early
March. The fruit yield ranges between
15-18 tons per hectare. Fruits can be
cold stored for 8-10 weeks. Packing in
punnet helps maintain quality during
transport. However, there is a need to
improve berry attachment for long
distance markets.

6. Sharad Seedless and its
clones
It is a clonal selection from the

Russian variety Kishmish Chernyi
(Black Sultana). Recently, 4 clonal

Fig. 6. Sharad Seedless

selections are made by farmers, those
respond well to hormone applications

with attractive berries. These
selections are Jumbo (Nath Seedless)
and Nana Purple for extra bold elliptic
berries, Sarita and Krishna with
oblong/ elliptical shaped berries with
attractive conical shaped bunches.

Salient features:

The berries are bluish black
with crisp pulp, oblong to elliptical in
shape and highly responsive to
Gibberellin treatment for berry size.
The fruit quality is better when
ripening coincides during cool climate.
It has a medium maturity and takes
about 125 days from pruning for
harvesting. Quality yields of 15-18
tons per hectare can be obtained with
proper canopy management, bunch
and berry thinning and berry sizing.
However, the berries are susceptible
to the bleaching as a result of SO;
injury during storage in fruit boxes
lined with grape guards. Hence the
variety is not suitable for long
duration storage/shipment, but can
be exported to short distant/ quick
accessible markets.

7. Crimson Seedless

It was obtained as a result of

Fig. 7. Crimson Seedless

cross between Emperor x C33-199 at
USDA, Fresno, California.

Salient features:

Vines are very vigorous.
Crimson Seedless berries are bright
red, large, cylindrical-oval and
seedless. They have thick, tough skin,
and firm crisp flesh with a neutral
flavour. Bunches are medium in size,
conical with a shoulder, and well filled
to slightly compact. This variety does
not require GAs for thinning/ sizing.
Some clusters may require a manual
thinning. It is a late ripening variety
and takes not less than 130 days from
pruning. The fruits are acidic and
usually harvested at sugar: acid ratio
of more than 25 for Indian markets.
The fruits can be cold stored up to 18-
20 weeks.

Newly introduced varieties

1. Autumn Royal

This variety was developed from
a cross of Autumn Black x C74-1, at
USDA, Fresno, California.

Salient features

The variety has bold berries,
purple black to black in colour, ovoid
to ellipsoidal in shape. The berry flesh
is firm and translucent, skin medium
thick. It is a late maturing variety.
This variety does not require GAs for
thinning/ sizing. Some clusters may
require a manual thinning. Without

gibberellin or girdling, berry weight
can average more than 8 gram.
However, to avoid post-harvest rachis
drying, a spray of 6-BA to clusters at
4 mm stage of berry growth is advised.
It is a late ripening variety, takes not
less than 135 days from pruning. The
fruits are harvested at sugar acid ratio
of 25. Fruits can be cold stored up to
14-16 weeks.

Vineyard
establishment on
rootstocks

J. SATISHA

Use of rootstocks in India is
only two to three decade old practice.
Prior to 1990’s most of the vineyards
were on own roots of commercial
varieties. However occurrence of
salinity build up and moisture stress
in these regions contributed for
decline in the productivity of own-
rooted vineyards. This prompted some
of the growers to use drought and salt
tolerant rootstocks in their vineyards.
The grafted vines outperformed the
own rooted Thompson Seedless vines
under the conditions of abiotic
stresses such as soil and water

salinity and water scarcity, which
prompted other grape workers to use
rootstocks to overcome these adverse
situations.

During the initial years of
establishing of vineyards on grape
rootstocks in India, “Dogridge” was
the only rootstock which was
commercially accepted by most of the
grape growers. Though this rootstock
performed better during initial years
of vineyard establishment, over the
years few problems encountered with
this rootstock such as more vigour on
scions, reduced fruitfulness,
accumulation of more sodium
resulting in uneven bud sprouting
and death of cordons etc. To overcome
these problems associated with
Dogridge under given soil and climatic
condition, growers started
establishing their vineyards on 110R
rootstock based on the research
findings of NRC Grapes, Pune.
Rootstock 110R was known to induce
less vigour on Thompson Seedless

Fig 1. Severity of moisture stress symptom in vines on own roots (left) than on
grafted vines (right)

6 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
scions, quick and uniform bud
sprouting, increased fruitfulness,
reduced accumulation of sodium in
leaf blades, cordons, petioles etc.
Hence, rootstock 110R has thus find
prominent place in Indian viticulture
and most of new vineyards are being
established on this rootstock.
However, some of the Thompson
Seedless vineyards grafted on
Dogridge rootstock is performing
better without facing any problems
related to vine vigour, fruit bud
differentiation, fruit yield, etc. which
clearly indicates that the performance
of particular rootstock is mostly
depends on the soil and irrigation
water quality in which it is grown and
also the viticultural operations being
followed. A rootstock which performs
better in a particular soil and climatic
condition may not perform similarly in
other soils. Some of the vineyards on
own rooted varieties are also
performing better. Hence, it is
necessary to consider soil and water
analysis before choosing particular
rootstock for establishing vineyards. A
list of rootstocks recommended for
different soil and irrigation water
qualities is shown in Table 1.

If the grape growers intended to
establish their vineyards on
rootstocks, the following practices
should be followed.

1. Purchase pure and true to type
rooted cuttings of rootstocks from
genuine nursery to avoid genetic
mixture.

2. The best time for planting
rootstocks in field is during
February — March.

3. Open the trenches of 2.5’ depth
and 2.5" width in North — South
direction of desired length. This
should be done at least one
month prior to planting. The
recommended spacing between
rows is about 9-10 ft.

4. Fill the trenches with top soil,

FYM, green manure, super
phosphate, etc. and irrigate
copiously.

5. At the time of planting, open the
pits at the desired planting
distance (5-6 ft for table grapes).

6. Plant the rooted cuttings in the
opened pits and irrigate
immediately to avoid

7. After 15 days of planting apply
fertilizers such as 19:19:19 and
urea alternately either through
fertigation or soil application for
good growth of rootstocks.

8. Allow all the shoots to grow for
about 50 days. This will help in
building up of sufficient food
reserves in the plant. After 50
days remove the weak and thin
shoots leaving only 2-3 strong and
healthy shoots. To make straight
growth of the retained shoots,
erect bamboo sticks in each basin
and tie the shoots to the bamboo
sticks.

9. The best season for in situ grafting
is during the month of September.
Wedge grafting is the preferred
method of grafting as it gives
maximum success and is also
simple method.

shoots of rootstocks are
decapitated at about 1.5 ft above
ground level. The grafting is
performed by opening slit on the
rootstock shoot and inserting
wedge shaped scion and tying
with polythene strips (Fig 3).

Irrigate the grafted plants
immediately to maintain sap flow
for better graft union.

Do not disturb graft union and
irrigate the vines continuously to
avoid desiccation. Care should be

taken to remove suckers
developed on rootstock portion as
those shoots are strong

competitors for water and
nutrients with sprouted shoots on
scion stick.

Once new shoots start developing,
train the shoots straight by tying
them to bamboo sticks.

As grafted plants start growing,
simultaneously the girth of graft
union also starts increasing. As a
result the tied polythene strip may
cause girdling in grafted region.
To avoid this, the tied polythene
strip should be removed carefully
with sharp knife and retie the
grafted region with new polythene
strip.

Uniformity in growth of all the
vines may be achieved by taking
recut in the following January -—
February months.

The re-cut is done by retaining
only two or three buds above graft
region.

The sprouted shoots are further
trained to trunk, primaries and
secondary (cordons) as per the
trellises employed in the vineyard

Training, pruning and
canopy management

R. G. SOMKUWAR

Grapevine is a climber. It has
indeterminate growth with weak stem.
It needs support not only for the
weight of its aerial parts and fruits
but also for maintaining the canopy
architecture. The trellis and the
system of training shape the canopy
architecture of vines. The fabricated
structure used for training the vines is
called the trellis while the process of
shaping the canopy is called training.
The manner in which a grapevine is
trained does not only influence the
vine growth, productivity and quality
but also brings about variation in
microclimate. Canopy management
starts out with the interaction of the
cultivar, vineyard site, seasonal
climate, inputs and the trellis system.
Canopy management of grapevines
deals with the development and
maintenance of their structure in
relation to size and shape for
maximum productivity and quality.
The basic concept in the canopy
management of perennial vines is to
make the best use of land and
climatic factors for increased
productivity. Tree vigour, sunlight,
temperature and relative humidity of
that region plays a great role in the
production and quality of fruits.

1. Training

Grapevine is trained to achieve
high quality production. There are
number of training systems used
worldwide, however, no single training
system is appropriate for all
situations. Based on the vine vigour,
degree of vineyard mechanisation and

Fig. 1. Grafting of scion

availability of the skill workers the
selection of training system is decided.
The growth potential of grapevine and
the condition under which the vine is
grown are never uniform. The trellis
used for training the vine is decided
during the first year itself.

4

Fig. 2. Training of rootstock

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 9
Fig. 3. Training after grafting

Training system used in
vineyard should fulfil the following
requirements.

1. The training system should be
cheap and economical.

2. The training system should help to
expose maximum leaf area to the
sunlight for better photosynthesis.

3. The vine trained to any type of
training system should promote
maximum bud break.

4. The training system should offer a
scope for mechanization with
respect to efficient fungicide/
insecticide sprays, harvesting of
maximum produce and pruning
practices.

5. The training system should
support the crop load to harvest
good quality grapes.

The training of grapevine is
performed to train different vine parts
in the initial year. These are as below.

1.1 Training of rootstock

After the re-cut of rootstock in
the field (before grafting), the selected
shoots of rootstock are trained to the
bamboo sticks so as to encourage

straight growth of trunk after grafting.
This helps in storage of required food
material in the developing trunk.

1.2 Training the trunk of
grafted vine

The grafted vine is tied with
bamboo stick so as to train the trunk
straight.

1.3 Training of primary arms
on Y trellis

Fig. 4. Training of primary arm

Immediately after re-cut of
grafted vines, the shoot grows
vigorously. This shoot should be
pinched six inch below the first wire
so as to train the primary shoot in a
slanting position. This will avoid the
direct sunlight exposure of the
primary arm.

1.4 Training of secondary arms
(cordon)

The cordon development should
be done based on the vigour of the
vine. Due to the presence of
prominent apical dominance in
Thompson Seedless and its clones,
the cordon development and training

10 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
]

Fig. 5. Training of secondary arms

should be done following ‘stop and go’
method. This will help to obtain
complete cordon with desirable length
during the first year.

2. Pruning

The pruning can be defined as
removal of plant parts to obtain
appropriate number of fruiting units.
The objective of pruning includes-

1. Controlling the size and form of a
vine.

2. To increase fruiting area on a vine.

3. Maintaining the balance between
vegetative growth and fruiting.

Fig. 6. Back pruning in grapes

4. Optimize the production potential
of vine.

5. To obtain better quality fruit from
the vine.

The pruning is done based on
the prevailing weather conditions in

that region. Under central parts of
India, the vine grows vigorously
throughout the year. Hence, double
pruning pattern is followed for grape
cultivation. The vines are pruned
during April by leaving basal single
bud on the shoot proximal to the
cordon. Since, the whole portion of
cane is pruned; this pruning is called
as back pruning. Fruit pruning is
done during October for getting fruits,
hence, it is also called as fruit
pruning. During fruit pruning, the
matured canes are pruned either after
knot on the sub cane or at 6-7 bud
position in case of straight canes.
However, the pruning position varies
with cane vigour and varieties.

3. Canopy Management

Canopy management refers to
the practices followed to obtain the
ideal characteristics in various canopy
components to realize the maximum
yield of quality grapes.

3.1 Canopy architecture

Canopy refers to the size and
shape of vine structure. The size and

shape of the canopy is dependent on
canopy components such as primary
arms and cordons, canes, shoots and
also on a given trellis/ training
system.

The ideal canopy should fulfil
the following requirements:

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 11
It should give the grapevine a
desirable shape and support the
crop load.

It should offer scope for convenient
field operations and
mechanization.

It should have adequate number of
fruitful canes.

It should allow sufficient light and
ventilation into the canopy during
the growth season.

It should give maximum
proportion of quality grapes per
unit area.

It should have sufficient foliar
coverage to nourish and protect
bunches during the fruiting season
(November-March).

It should avoid overlapping of the
foliage to facilitate efficient
photosynthesis by every leaf.

It should offer scope for effective
spray coverage with pesticides and
growth regulators.

It should not build up micro-
climate that is congenial for
disease development.

The requirement of canopy

during each pruning under tropical
region is as below.

3.2 Canopy management after

foundation pruning

1. The ideal stage for shoot thinning

is at 4-5 leaf stage. This helps in

reducing the loss of nutrients from
the vine.

. The number of shoots retained on
vine should be 0.70-1.0 per ft? for
quality produce.

. The canopy should be open during

April — September to facilitate
optimum sunlight harvesting
required for efficient
photosynthesis.

. The shoots on each cordon should
be vertically positioned to harvest
maximum sunlight required for
fruit bud differentiation.

. While removing the excess shoots
from the cordon, remove both
vigorous and weaker shoots so
that all the shoots will be uniform
in diameter. This will promote

7. While making the sub cane, pinch
the shoot to 7- leaves at 9- leaf

8. Top the side shoot again at Sth leaf
when it is at 7- leaf stage.

leaf stage. This helps in increasing
the fruit bud differentiation.

10.Top the shoots to 15- leaves (7+8)
when the shoots start maturing.
This helps to store enough food
material and advance cane
maturity.

3.3 Canopy management after
fruit pruning

1. Before fruit pruning, collect the
canes (about 40 canes/acre) of
different thickness (6-8 mm, 8-10
mm and >10 mm diameter) and
examine their buds under
microscope for position of fruitful
bud. This helps to decide pruning
position to obtain maximum
number of bunches.

2. The canes of 6 mm and less
diameter are to be removed during
fruit pruning.

Fig. 12. Stage of excess shoot
removal after fruit pruning

. Swab hydrogen cyanamide only to

apical 2-3 buds on each cane. This
helps in early and uniform bud
break.

. Based on the bud break and the

bunch emergence, shoot thinning
is to be performed at 4-5 leaf
stage.

. Bunches are to be retained based

on vine spacing. Retain one bunch
for every 1-1.5 ft2 of canopy for
quality grapes.

. Excess shoot removal to be done at

4-5 leaf stage.

. Bunch thinning should be followed

at pre- bloom stage only.

Fig. 13. Stage of excess bunch
removal

. Retain only one or two bearing

shoots on each cane. If the cane
diameter is more than 8 mm,
retain two bearing shoots and only

one shoot if the diameter is less
than 8 mm.

Encourage the shoot growth by
applying more nitrogen and water
until one month after fruit set.

10.Thin the berries and clip the

clusters to reduce the number of
berries in relation to the cane
thickness. Retain 16 berries in a
cluster per mm diameter of the
cane.

Position the shoots appropriately
to provide shade to the bunches on
the South-West side of the canopy.

Retain only 100-120 berries in a
bunch and remove all excess
berries. This operation should be
done immediately after berry
setting. This helps in proper berry
development and achieving the
desirable berry size for quality
produce.

Shoot topping is done at 10-12 leaf
above bunch after fruit pruning to
avoid competition for nutrients by
the shoot and consolidate the food
material in the developing

Fig. 15. The vine before harvest

bunches. This helps in increasing
the berry size.

14.To increase the berry size, girdling

is one of the important operations
beside use of growth regulators
and cluster thinning. All these are
complementary to each other.
Therefore care should be taken to
use these practices judiciously.
Girdling helps in increasing the
berry size at least by one mm
diameter.

15.The time of girdling differs among

varieties. In Thompson Seedless,
the girdling is done at 4-6 mm
berry size whereas in Sharad
Seedless, it is done at 6-8 mm
berry size.

Nutrient and water
management

J. SHARMA
A. K. UPADHYAY

Application of nutrients and
irrigation to soil depends on the site
selected for grape cultivation. Site
selection in terms of soil and climatic
condition is one of the important
factors to be considered before
establishing vineyard. Soil properties
in terms of soil texture and structure,
soil pH, depth, availability and quality
of irrigation play a major role in
successful viticulture. Similarly,
climatic factors prevailing in the area
with respect to rainfall pattern,
temperature, light intensity, relative
humidity also determine the success
of grape cultivation. Though grapes
can be cultivated on varied soil and
climatic conditions, deep and well-
drained soils with pH range of 6.5 —
8.0 is ideal. The soil pH above or
below this range is known to restrict
availability of some nutrient elements
and thus inhibit growth and
development. Grapevines generally
require hot and dry climate during its
growth and fruiting period. Either very
hot or very mild and cold climate
during fruit ripening creates
imbalance in sugar acid blend thus
reducing fruit quality.

Grapevines once planted stays
at the site for a period of about 15-20
years. Favourable rooting
environment and proper
understanding of the phenology of
vine is key to efficient water and
nutrient management. Nutrient
availability to plants is dependent
upon soil pH and its composition,
amounts of nutrients in the soil and

soil environment. Thus, regular soil
testing can determine status and
changes in its composition and any
toxicity, which may impede nutritional
balance. Further, grape roots being
spread deep in the soils, vines may
not respond to the (fertilizer
application as predicted by soil
testing, hence, petiole testing also
becomes very important. The petiole
samples should be drawn during both
foundation and fruit pruning seasons
and sent for analysis to a recognized
laboratory in order to know the
nutrient status for vegetative growth
and fruiting respectively.

Water is a critical input for
grape production. Quality of water in
terms of salinity, presence of specific
ion (sodium, chloride, boron, nitrate
etc.), carbonates and bicarbonates will
have an impact on the quantum of
water required for the vine cultivation
as well as on the nutrient requirement
based on vine phenology. Test the
irrigation water and soil for presence
of heavy metals viz. arsenic,
cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper,
mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, tin
and thallium from the food safety
point of view.

Before starting the foundation
and fruit prunings, the grower should
draw samples from the root zone of
the soil to a depth of 30 cm from all
sides of the point of application of drip
water after harvest (during rest
period). Simultaneously, they should
also test the irrigation water quality.

Apply fertilizer based on soil
and petiole test report. The nutrient
input from organic manures and
irrigation water should also be taken
into consideration while deciding the
quantity of nutrients to be applied at
specific crop growth stage. The
grower while procuring the fertilizer
should also check the label details on
the fertilizer bag and ensure from the
dealer about its meeting the
specifications as per Fertilizer Control
Order (1985) of Government of India

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 15
and latest amendments. Similarly, the
grower while procuring composts and
organic materials must demand from
the supplier or satisfy them about the
product being free from heavy metals
as stated above. Irrigation water
particularly from groundwater sources
can supply large quantities to meet
crop needs of nutrients like nitrogen
(nitrate-N), magnesium, calcium etc.
For example- if irrigation water
contains 20 ppm nitrate-N and about
20,00,000 liters of irrigation water is
applied per acre in a year it will add
40 kg N as nitrate -N. Hence dose of
nitrogenous fertilizers should be
adjusted accordingly.

The nutrient and water
requirement based on crop growth
stages for Thompson Seedless vines
raised on Dogridge rootstock are
shown in table 1. This schedule can
also be used for Thompson Seedless
vines raised on 110R rootstock. The
sprouting time of 10-12 days is
considered for arriving at a given
growth stage. The method of
irrigation for vineyard is surface or
drip system. These recommendations
are for guidance purpose only and
may change based on site conditions
of vineyard. Further, The optimum
range of petiole nutrient contents for
Thompson Seedless vines grafted on
Dogridge rootstock are given in table
2. For visual diagnosis of nutrient
deficiencies refer figure 1.

1. Nutrient and water
management after
foundation pruning

1.1 0-40 days after foundation
pruning

Apply recommended
amendments and FYM at or before
pruning. At the time of pruning apply
FYM @ 25 ton/ha. Apply 30%
nitrogen of the annual N needs during
first 40 days after pruning and 20% of
the annual P fertilizer dose between
31-40 days after pruning. Apply Zn
and boron during 20-40 days to

promote desired shoot growth.
However, if the soil test value
indicates deficiency, apply
micronutrient (Zn, Fe, Mn and Boron)
after bud swelling stage. Apply starter
dose magnesium if the deficiency was
indicated by the soil and petiole test
during the previous fruiting season.

Apply proper quantity of
irrigation water based on pan
evaporation rates to achieve desired
canopy. Expected pan evaporation
during first 40 days may range from
8-12 mm per day. Accordingly the
irrigation water needed will range
from 33,600 to 50,400 litres per
hectare per day.

1.2 40- 60 days after foundation
pruning

Petiole testing: Collect the
petiole from the fully mature leaf at 5th
node position from the base of a cane
at bud differentiation stage (33-35
days after bud sprouting) and send for
analysis to a recognized laboratory. If
the test report indicates the nutrient
(s) as excess or very high, stop the
application of that nutrient.

Apply 40% of the annual P dose
during this period. If potassium
deficiency symptoms such as inward
leaf curling or shiny spot on leaves is
noticed during the first month of
growth (vegetative growth), start
potassium application early. In case
petiole test values indicate low
magnesium content, apply
magnesium by foliar spray not
exceeding 0.5% concentration followed
by soil application of 100 kg
magnesium sulphate per hectare in
four splits. Apply zinc and boron
during 40- 60 days as per petiole test
report preferably by foliar sprays.

Reduce the irrigation to 1/3rd
compared to first 40 days to facilitate
fruit bud differentiation. Expected pan
evaporation during this stage may
range from 8-10 mm. Accordingly
11,200 to 14,000 litres of irrigation
water per hectare per day will be

16 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
needed. Excess irrigation or soil
moisture at this stage will result in
poor fruitfulness.

Grow a green manure crop in
the rainy season. It also helps in
suppressing the weeds. Plough the
green manure crop when it is in
flowering stage.

1.3 60 to 120 days after
foundation pruning

Apply 30% of annual potassium
dose during 60 to 120 days after
foundation pruning.

This stage also coincides with
rainy season hence, irrigation may not
be needed. If there are no rains
continue irrigation as per the
requirement.

2. Nutrient and water
management after fruit

pruning

2.1 0-40 days after fruit
pruning
Apply recommended

amendments and FYM at or before
pruning. At the time of pruning apply
FYM @ 25 ton/ha. Apply 30% of the
annual nitrogen dose during first 40
days after pruning. Start
micronutrient (Zn, Fe, Mn and Boron)
and magnesium application after bud
swelling stage if the soil test value
indicates deficiency and deficiency
was established after foundation
pruning. Apply magnesium as foliar
sprays @ 0.3 to 0.5% for quick
correction of deficiency. In case of
both P and Ca deficiency, application
of superphosphate mixed with
FYM/composts at the time of pruning
will take care of both. Apply Zn and
boron during 20-40 days to promote
desired shoot growth preferably as
foliar sprays. Take special care of
potassium deficiency and start early
application of potassium in case of
deficiency. If the symptoms like
inward leaf curling and or shiny spots
are noticed on the leaves, apply 25 kg

of sulphate of potash and spray
potassium sulphate @ 3-5 g/L
depending on leaf age.

Expected pan evaporation during first
40 days when vines are pruned in
October may range from 6-8mm per
day. Accordingly, the irrigation water
needed will range from 25,200 to
33,600 litres per hectare per day.

2.2 40- 70 days after fruit
pruning

Petiole testing: Test the petioles
from the leaf opposite to
cluster/bunch at full bloom stage.
Modify the fertilizer doses accordingly.
If the test report indicates the nutrient
(s) as excess or very high stop the
application of that nutrient.

Apply 30% of annual
phosphorus dose during this period. If
petiole test values indicate low
magnesium content, apply
magnesium by foliar spray not
exceeding 0.5% concentration followed
by soil application of 100 kg
magnesium sulphate per hectare in
four splits. If the potassium deficiency
symptoms like inward leaf curling or
shiny spots are noticed on the leaves,
apply 25 kg of sulphate of potash and
spray potassium sulphate @ 3-5 g/L
depending on leaf age. Apply zinc and
boron preferably by foliar sprays to
overcome the deficiency fast. Boron
may also be applied in soil via drip
irrigation apart from foliar spays in
case of sever deficiency.

Reduce the irrigation during
41-55 days in clayey soil to one-third
compared to earlier stage to facilitate
berry thinning. Expected pan
evaporation during this stage may
range from 4-6 mm. Accordingly
5,600 to 8,400 litres of irrigation
water per hectare per day will be
needed. Fifty five days after fruit
pruning increase the amount of
irrigation water. Expected pan
evaporation during this stage may
range from 3-6 mm. Accordingly,

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 17
12,600 to 25,200 litres of irrigation
water per hectare per day will be
needed. Light textured soil will need
more irrigation and the irrigation
should be reduced to 50% only
compared to vegetative growth stage.

2.3 70 to 105 days after fruit
pruning

Apply 30% each of nitrogen and
potassium dose during this period.
Apply magnesium preferably by foliar
spray not exceeding 0.5%
concentration. For overcoming
calcium deficiency in developing
berries due to unfavourable climatic
conditions or nutrient imbalances in
soil, apply preferably as foliar
application. Two to three sprays may
be needed.

Expected pan evaporation
during this stage may range from 3-6
mm. Accordingly, 12,600 to 25,200
litres of irrigation water per hectare
per day will be needed.

2.4 105 days after fruit
pruning to Harvest

Apply 30% of potassium dose
during this period. Apply magnesium
by foliar sprays not exceeding 0.5 %
concentration in case of suspected
deficiency.

Expected pan evaporation
during this stage may range from 8-10
mm. Accordingly, 33,600 to 42,000
litres of irrigation water per hectare
per day will be needed. Do not over
irrigate otherwise it may lead to
problems like water berry and
cracking.

3. Secondary and
Micronutrients

. Sulphur deficiency is rarely
observed in vineyards since
considerable quantities are
indirectly added by use of S
containing fertilisers like SOP
and S as fungicide

. Calcium deficiency in
calcareous soils is not common

and do not require specific
fertiliser application unless
vineyard soil has high pH or
sodium. Certain climatic
conditions (cold or rainy) or
nutrient imbalance in soils
may cause Ca deficiency in
fruits (berries) which can be
corrected by two to three foliar
applications or bunch dipping
between fruit set and veraison
stage @ 0.3 to 0.5% (calcium
chloride or calcium nitrate)

Apply magnesium sulphate @
100 kg per hectare per pruning
season in four splits for
maintenance dose. However,
the application must be done
only if need is established
based on petiole test value
since in many vineyards
ground water irrigation source
may add substantial quantities
of Mg in soil.

Amongst the micronutrients,
zinc and iron are the most
commonly deficient nutrients.

Due to large variation in the
type and content of calcium
carbonate in soil, no specific
recommendations are available.
However, under established
deficient conditions, on an
average 50 kg per hectare each
of zinc sulphate, ferrous
sulphate and manganese
sulphate should be applied per
season.

Micronutrients are preferably
applied as foliar application
and based on petiole analysis.
On an average, 3-4 sprays of
0.2-0.4 % of sulphate forms of
Zn, Mn and Fe in a pruning
season meet the crop needs.

Boron is strictly applied on the
basis of petiole analysis report.

* The above growth stages generally coincide with rainy season and no irrigation may be

required in heavy soils.

**

The schedule has been worked based on experiment carried out in heavy and

calcareous soils using saline irrigation water (EC ranging from 1.7-1.8 dS/m) and
therefore this may be taken as guideline for stage wise irrigation for other soil types
other than the one specified here.

Note:

. Depending on water quality, the amount of water needed may change. Irrigation
should not be applied after the soil has reached field capacity after rain.

Irrigation requirement will be less by 20% compared to above given schedule if low
salinity water (EC less than 1.0 dS/m) is used.

By application of organic mulch (3” thick layer of Bagasse and covering the 3 feet
wide vine root zone strip) @ 10 t per acre or plastic mulch in combination with
spraying of Anti-stress (permitted biodegradable acrylic polymer) @ 4-6 ml/ L at 30,
60 and 90 days after foundation pruning and 30 and 60 days after fruit pruning, the
irrigation water quantity could be reduced by 25%. Mulching also reduces weed
incidence.

The irrigation water requirement can be reduced by 25 % in the existing surface drip
irrigated system by applying irrigation directly in the root zone at 9 inches depth in
heavy soils and at 4 inches depth in light soil. Any hollow pipe of 2.5 inches
diameter open on both sides (PVC pipes, earthen pipes, discarded plastic bottles)
with holes on lower side and microtubes can be used for delivering irrigation water
in the root zone in heavy soils. This irrigation technique also reduces weed
incidence.

This experiment was conducted in a row to row and vine to vine spacing of 10’ x 6’.
Irrigation and fertigation schedules can be suitably applied up to a row to row and
vine to vine spacing of 8 x 5.

The nutrient quantity given are guidelines for distributing the NPK doses at different
growth stages and may change based on the site and climatic conditions.

One kg P=2.29 kg P»Os5 and one kg K=1.21 kg K,O

Under normal climatic conditions generally, it takes 10-12 days for sprouting.

The nutrient applications should necessarily take into account soil, petiole and
water testing report.

Contribution of nutrients from other sources like composts, FYM, green manuring
irrigation water, etc. should also be taken into consideration for adjusting the
nutrient dose. All the manures and fertilizers, irrigation water and other inputs
should be tested for presence of heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb,
Sn, and T1) before use.

Even though the above mentioned petiole K content (0.59 — 0.68%) at bud
differentiation stage is sufficient in soils high in available K content,
nevertheless there are chances of leaf curling, which could affect management
of disease and pests due to inadequate spray coverage. It is therefore, advisable
to maintain petiole K levels at bud differentiation stage above 1.5%.

Use of bioregulators
for quality grape
production

S. D. RAMTEKE

Hormonal balance in any plant
system is as delicately interwoven and
as distinct as a spider web. Any
imbalance created in the hormonal
system by injudicious usage of the
growth regulators will collapse the
entire plant system. So, one has to
use growth regulators very judiciously
in order to maintain the balance of
endogenous hormones and physiology
of the vine.

Quality improvement in grapes
is aimed at the production of loose
bunches, increasing berry size, sugar
content and firmness. While using
growth regulators for quality
improvement, it is to be borne in mind
that growth regulators bring out
improvement in quality through
changing the growth or diverting the
flow of metabolites into the berries,
but do not increase the quality
parameters by themselves directly.
They are the mediators. The basic
requirements are the metabolites, i.e.
the carbohydrates or proteins in the
plant system. In the absence of these
metabolites in the plant system, use
of growth regulators cannot bring
about the desired effect.

Bio-regulators are used in
grape for various purposes viz.
increasing fruitfulness, inducing bud
break apart from increasing rachis
elongation for production of well filled
bunch, berry setting and also for
increase in berry size besides quality
improvement & increase in shelf life.

Application of bioregulators
with their doses, stage of application
is summarized in table 1.

1. Budbreak

Fig. 1. Budbreak

After fruit pruning, hydrogen
cyanamide 50 SL @ 30-40ml/L (based
on cane thickness) is applied on
apical 2-3 buds within 2 days of
pruning to increase uniform
budbreak.

2. Cluster Elongation

Fig. 2. Rachis / cluster elongation

Clusters are treated with
Gibberellic acid (GAs) for cluster
elongation, thinning and to increase
berry size.

GAs @ 10 ppm is used as foliar
spray when the cluster is at parrot
green stage. After 4-5 days, GAs @ 15
ppm can be given as a dip for rachis
elongation and cluster growth. If the
cluster is still small then GAs @ 20
ppm can be used as a foliar spray.
The pH of the solution at every time of
growth regulator usage should be
acidic (pH 5.5 - 6.5).

3. Berry thinning

If required, GAs is sprayed @ 40
ppm at 50 percent flowering stage.
This reduces the berry set and results
in berry thinning. To enhance the
efficacy of GAj;, the pH of the spray
solution should be acidic (5.5 to 6.5).

4. Berry elongation

Treatment of GAs after berry set

Fig. 3. 50% flowering and berry thinning

will increase their size by elongation.
Treat the clusters with GAs for berry
elongation at 3-4 mm berry size.

5. Increasing berry
diameter

For quality grape, berry
diameter is more important than the
berry length or the overall size of the
berries. GAs (@ 40 ppm) along with
CPPU (forechlorofenuron) 0.1%L (@1-2
ppm) is used at 3-4 mm berry size
and second dip of GAs @ 30 ppm +
CPPU @ 1 or 2 ppm at 6-8 berry stage. Fig. 5 Berry size of 6-7 mm diameter

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 25
The use of CPPU at these two stages
also helps to retain the green colour of
berries.

The above schedule has to be
followed according to leaf / fruit ratio
as mentioned in chapter 3.

6. Improving shelf life

Shelf life may be improved by
dipping the clusters with calcium
nitrate @ 1 % aqueous solution at 75
to 105 days after fruit pruning or by
treating the clusters with NAA @ 100
ppm in 2 split doses ten days prior to
harvest.

7. Do’s and Don’ts for
application of
bioregulators

7.1 Cluster and berry thinning
7.1.1 Do’s

1. Spray GAs @ 10 ppm at parrot
green stage of cluster and 15 ppm
GA; after 4-5 days of 1st spray.

2. GAs spray solution should be
acidic (pH 5.5 - 6.5). Use citric or
phosphoric acid or urea phosphate
as a adjuvant to lower down the
pH of spray solution.

3. Dip the clusters with 40 ppm GAs
at 50% flowering if necessary.
Treat individual cluster selectively.

4. Cut the tips of clusters
immediately after set by retaining
8-10 apical branches depending on
the number of leaves available for
a bunch.

5. Thin the berries manually before
3-4 mm berry size stage.

6. If thinning is inadequate remove
the alternate branch of the rachis
to retain 5-6 branches and clip the
tip of the bunch 8 days after set.

7. Use sufficient spray solution to
have optimum coverage of foliage
as well as clusters.

7.1.2 Don’ts

1. Do not use the solvent (acetone /
methanol) more than 30 ml per g
of GAs.

2. Do not spray GAs at pre-bloom
stage without fungicide if the
weather is cloudy and humid,
particularly if it is likely to rain, to
avoid excessive flower drop.

3. Do not spray GAs at full bloom or
immediately after berry set to
avoid berry shatter and formation
of shot berries.

4. Do not girdle the vines before 3-4
mm berry size stage.

5. Avoid injury to the berries while
thinning mechanically by scissors.

6. Do not use [AA along with GAs for
cluster elongation.

7.2 Berry size
7.2.1 Do’s

1. 1-2 ppm CPPU to 30-40 ppm GAs
and dip the clusters in the mixed
solution once at 3-4 mm stage and
again at 6-7 mm berry size stage.
Selection of concentration of
growth regulators for dipping
should depend on the number of
leaves available per bunch.

2. Clip off the tip of the cluster by
1/34 or 1/4th of its length, since
the under developed berries are

mostly formed in the lower half of
the bunch.

3. Ensure that all berries in a cluster
receive all GAs treatments
uniformly.

4. Ensure adequate leaf/fruit ratio
for a developing bunch (6-8 berries

/ leaf).
7.2.2 Don’ts

1. Do not induce more bud break
than required per cane. Three
buds on canes thicker than 10
mm, two on canes with thickness
of 8-10 mm and one on the canes

26 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
with thickness ranging between 6-
8 mm.

Do not allow the clusters to
develop on a shoot having less
than 8 leaves.

Do not treat the clusters with
CPPU when the bearing shoot has
inadequate leaf area, and the
shoots are less vigorous.

4. Do not delay berry thinning

beyond 8-10 mm stage of berries.

Do not treat the berries with GAs
nor girdle the vines from berry set
to shatter stage. Since this may

lead to more shot berries in a
bunch.

Disease management

S.D. SAWANT
INDU S. SAWANT

Downy mildew, powdery mildew
and anthracnose are the three
important diseases caused by fungal
pathogens and require warm and wet
/ humid conditions for causing
infections. During monsoon, downy
mildew and anthracnose are the
major diseases noticed on the leaves,
while powdery mildew appears when
there is a long gap of rain with cloudy
conditions. Sometimes, rust infection
also occurs on old leaves especially
during September.

From April to first week of June
usually the climate is hot with
temperature ranging from 35-40°C
and dry with relative humidity > 40%,
hence there is least possibility of
development of any disease. However
diseases occur during monsoon period
when rains are received any time from
second week of June till middle of
October. In most grape growing areas
300 to 500 mm rain is received
annually and there are about 30-45
days recording more than 4 mm rain
per day from June to October.

Fig. 1. Grape leaves showing oily
spot symptoms of downy mildew

By the time monsoon sets in,
majority of the canes would have
developed more than 12 leaves and
shoot growth is normally brought
under control. In the absence of
growing shoots, application of non-
systemic fungicides can give equally
good results. Copper fungicides in
general are broad spectrum and have
good rain fastness, thus show good
results during wet conditions. During
September, it rains in most of the
grape growing areas and as a result of
this diseased leaves drop off early.
Accumulation of chlorides and salts,
in general, in saline areas also lead to
early leaf drop. After leaves are
dropped off the new shoots start
growing which not only attracts
infection of downy mildew and
anthracnose but also reduces stored
food resources of the cane. Strategy of
disease management after back
pruning is, therefore, aims at
providing protection during wet
weather, to reduce the disease on the
first 12 leaves of the canes and to
make them stronger to resist drop till
fruit pruning.

In most grape growing areas of
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka, normal time of fruit
pruning is around 15th of October, but
it can range from first week of July to
last week of November. From disease
management point of view, fruit
pruning taken before 15th of October
has greater risk of downy mildew, as
there are more chances of rains and
temperature is warmer. After fruit
pruning, about 8-10 days are needed
for sprouting of buds. Thereafter on

Fig. 2. Growth of downy mildew on
lower surface of the leaf

28 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
an average every three days interval
new leaf is developed. At fifth leaf
there will be a bunch, which takes
about 35 to 45 days from fruit
pruning to develop to flowering stage
and by 50 to 55 days fruits set in.
First 50 to 55 days after pruning, risk
of damages due to downy mildew
infection on bunches is very high.
Rains and heavy dew during this
period helps development of downy
mildew on bunches. Leaf wetness for
continuous period of three hours after
sunrise is favourable for new
infection. If such conditions prevail
during first 55 days of pruning,
sprays of fungicides are needed at
shorter intervals for effective control of
downy mildew. Berries develop to 10
to 12 mm size within first 70-75 days
after fruit pruning and thereafter the
risk of downy mildew gradually
reduces. Rains during November and
December are rare, but in years when
it rains during November or
thereafter, heavy losses due to downy
mildew are observed. Normally, 5 to 6
sprays of fungicides are required
during first 55 days of pruning for
effective management of downy
mildew. This number of sprays may
be increased to 9 in the event of rains
during November- December, while it
can be reduced to 3-4 when wet
weather is absent after fruit pruning.

Details of chemicals, their
doses, PHI, MRLs are given in

spots

Annexure I.

1. How to take decision on
“what to spray?” and
“when to spray?”

1.1 When new infection of
downy mildew occurs?

Infection of downy mildew
takes place when leaf, bunch or cane
is wet during day time at least for 2.5
to 3.0 hours. Such condition is
present when it rains or RH is very
high after rains and fog or dew
remains for long time in the morning.

1.2 Preventive spray is needed
when new infection is
likely

The vineyard needs to be
protected when new infection of
downy mildew is likely to take place.
Therefore, 10 days onwards, after fruit
pruning the grower is expected to
watch the vineyard for presence of
dew on leaves and bunches, every
morning. If the, temperature is above
10 °C, and dew is present on leaves
after 9.0 am, the resultant leaf
wetness period is sufficient to
complete the process of new infection.
Under such situation, decision to
spray will depend on the following
observations.

eo Whether the last spray of systemic

appearance on surface

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 29
fungicide for control of downy
mildew was given within 3-4 days?

v' If not, spray is required.

v If the spray was given within
last 3-4 days, even though leaf
wetness is present, spray may
not be required till about 4
days have passed after this
spray.

v' The following other factors
may also be considered for
making decision to spray
Weather forecast: if it is likely
to rain within a day or two,
spray can be preponed.

v' Presence of active inoculum of
downy mildew in close
vicinity: if the oily spots (Photo
1) of downy mildew are seen
in same or in nearby vineyard
immediate spray may be
needed.

1.3 Weather forecast helps in
scheduling sprays

Location specific weather
forecast for next 5 to 7 days is
available on internet nowadays.
Information on forecast of rain is often
useful in scheduling sprays, especially
during critical stages of growth. In
most cases rainy condition lasts for 2
to 3 days. Preventive spray given
before rains often protects vineyard
from downy mildew for 2 to 3 days of
rainy condition. Even if new downy

mildew infection takes place, its
establishment and appearance of first
symptom such as oily spots and
subsequent sporulation needs at least
3 days after infection. This means if
the preventive spray is given just
before rains, the grower can safely
wait for 3 to 4 days of rainy weather
and give subsequent spray only after
rains have stopped. However, this can
be effectively done when location
specific weather forecast is available.

NRC for Grapes, Pune gives
summary of weather forecast of 7
days, for major grape growing areas

1.4 Important risk periods for
downy mildew

While taking decision on sprays
for downy mildew, growth stage
related risk needs to be taken in to
consideration.

First 10-50 days after fruit
pruning are important for
management of downy mildew.

1.4.1 10 to 25 days after pruning

At this stage, new shoot is
slowly growing. To protect new shoots,
two preventive sprays of systemic
fungicides for downy mildew,
preferably belonging to low risk group
as per Fungicide Resistance Action
Committee (FRAC) classification, are
required.

1.4.2 26 to 35 days after pruning

At this stage, young light green
coloured bunch is just visible and
rapid elongation of cane is visible.
Application of GA3 as spray or bunch
dip, for bunch rachis elongation, is
given during this period. GA3
application makes shoots and bunch
more succulent and more sensitive to
downy mildew. Two more preventive
sprays of systemic fungicides for
downy mildew are required during
this period.

36 to 50 days after pruning:
At this stage, the flowers in the bunch
start opening. When flower cap starts
separating, it allows dew water to
accumulate and remain on bunch for
longer period. This leads to bunch
infection of downy mildew even when
weather is not very suitable for downy
mildew. In case of mild infection,
losses could occur due to flower drop
or by drying off of bunchlets. Hence,
during this period 1 or 2 additional
preventive sprays of systemic
fungicides for downy mildew are
required.

1.5 Care needed if it rains
during December

By December, most vineyards
will have progressed beyond flowering
and berry setting stage. In the event of
normal weather, it rarely rains during
December. Most grape growing areas
in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and
Karnataka will have considerably
reduced temperature and night
temperature will be close to 10°C.

Whenever, wet weather and
young growing shoots are present
there is a risk of downy mildew and
anthracnose. High humidity,
moderate temperature, and low light
intensity due to crowded canopy or
due to cloudy conditions increase the
risk of powdery mildew.

Anthracnose

Spray Carbendazim 50 WP, 1.0g / L (1Kg / ha) at
emergence of bud or immediately after rains for control of
anthracnose.

Add 25 to 30 g citric acid per 100 L of spray water before
adding above fungicides to ensure that the pH of the
spraying liquid is in acidic range.

Spray Ziram 27 SL @ 4.0 ml / L or Chloronthalonil @ 2.0
g/L orCOC@3.0g/ L or Copper hydroxide 77WP @
2.0g / L, 7-10 days after the spray of systemic fungicide.
Spray of such non-systemic fungicide is needed when it
rains after first spray.

If any anthracnose infected new shoot is noticed,
manually remove the shoot.

Powdery mildew

Spray Sulphur 80 WDG 2.0 g / L or Potassium bi-
carbonate @ 10.0g/ L

Use of spreaders (Silwet or Sure-shot) @ 0.1 to 0.2 ml / L

Spray copper fungicides COC SOWP@ 3.0g / L., or
Copper hydroxide 77WP @ 1.5 g /L or 0.5 % Bordeaux
mixture to control all or any one of the three diseases.

Alternatively, spray of any non-systemic fungicide
recommended for control of both downy mildew and
anthracnose in Annexure I eg. ziram, mancozeb, captan,
chlorenthalonil etc.

Repeat after 10-15 days interval, during breaks in rain. By
the end of July, if 2 to 3 sprays of copper fungicides are
given depending up on rainfall pattern, outbreak of downy
mildew or anthracnose is effectively controlled.

In late pruned vineyards, where shoot growth up to first
10 to 12 leaves is still continuing, spray Carbendazim
S0WP @ 1.0 g/L alone or in combination with COC S0WP
@ 2.5 to 3.0 g / L to control only anthracnose.

Powdery mildew

Use spreaders (Silwet or Sure-shot )@ 0.1 to 0.2 ml / L for
better efficiency of above fungicides

Do not spray Dinocap if tender shoots are present in
canopy.

At the end of July especially after the onset of monsoon
downy mildew and powdery mildew can be present
together in vineyards. In such situations, mixture of
sulphur 8OWDG @ 2.0 g / L and 0.5 % Bordeaux mixture
can be sprayed. The pH of the Bordeaux mixture should
be adjusted after the mixing of sulphur.

In case of potassium deficiency, spray of mono-potassium
sulphate (0:52:34 grade of soluble fertilizers), or sulphate
of potash (SOP) @ 2-3 g / L could give considerable
reduction in powdery mildew incidence.

In continuously cloudy climate spray any systemic
fungicide belonging to triazole groups (eg. hexaconazole,
penconazole, flusilazole, myclobutanil, tetraconazole etc.)
at regular recommended dose (Annexure-I) along-with
potassium bicarbonate 5.0 g/L.

on old leaves.

Spray Sulphur 80 WDG @ 2 g/L. plus Bordeaux mixture
0.5%, if both downy mildew and powdery mildew infection
is present

Use of copper fungicides mentioned above should control
rust disease also. In case if the disease is found to
increase, spray systemic fungicides such as, flusilazole
40EC @ 0.025 ml / L.

Spray mineral oil formulation such as HP grape spray oil
@ 5.0 to 10 ml/L. Such spray oils are not compatible with
sulphur and copper fungicides, and captan. Hence ensure
that al-least 20 days have passed after the spray of such

fungicides, before the spray of mineral oil formulations.

Spray 1 % Bordeaux Mixture within 1-2 days of pruning on
canes and arms to kill left over disease inoculums.

Mix mancozeb 75 WP, 5 to 7 g/L with hydrogen cyanamide
solution for swabbing canes. This will help in killing
pathogen inoculums (of downy mildew and anthracnose) if
present on canes. If mancozeb is mixed with hydrogen
cyanamide, use of red colour can be avoided as yellowish
colour of mancozeb will help identifying treated cane in
vineyard.

If the un-pruned block is in close vicinity of pruned block,
and the pruning in that block is not likely to take place
within 5-8 days, it will be essential to spray 0.5 %
bordeaux mixture in un-pruned block to avoid movement
of inoculums from unpruned block to young shoots in
pruned block. Sporangia of downy mildew can travel
through air up to 100 m distance, while conidia of powdery
mildew can be disseminated through air up to long
distances.

While staggering pruning in vineyards direction of air also
should be taken in to consideration. Normally during
October wind direction is East to west, hence early pruned
blocks in the vineyard should be preferably in the eastern
side so that there will be the least possibility of movement
of airborne inoculums from unpruned blocks to new
shoots in pruned block.

8 days after Anthracnose, Xanthomonas

forward pruning Spray systemic fungicides such as carbendazim @ 1.0 g /
L or difenconazole 25 EC @ 0.5 g/L, followed by non-
systemic fungicides COC @ 3 g / L or copper hydroxide 77
WP @ 1.25 g/L after 2-3 days. Sprays of copper based
fungicides can restrict the infection of bacterium
Xanthomonas, and are useful in avoiding development of]
resistance in anthracnose pathogen against systemic
fungicides.

10 days onwards |Downy mildew

Sprays for downy mildew control are needed when new
shoots remain wet due to dew up to 8 to 9 am in the
morning or it rains during the day.

Sprays of systemic fungicides are needed at every three
days interval after 10 days of pruning. However, in the
absence of rainy condition, and if morning dew is not very
heavy, spray interval can be extended up to 5 days. One
additional spray of non-systemic fungicides can be given
between two systemic fungicides to reduce the risk of the
disease.

List of recommended systemic and non-systemic

34 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes
Days after

stage

Control measure for disease

fungicides is given in Annexure The list is updated every
year during October and is available on website of NRC for
Grapes (http: //nrcgrapes.nic.in )

Spray anyone of the systemic fungicides from the list at 3
leaf stage, 5 leaf stage or 7 leaf stage as mandatory sprays,
while maintaining spray interval at 5 days.

Avoid using fungicides such as azoxystrobin, kresoxim
methyl during first 18 to 20 days growth after forward
pruning.

Spray for downy mildew should be preventive and should
be given before the start of rainy days or after the rainy
days are over.

If the rainy days are extended beyond 3 days, or when
spray before the start of rainy days could not be given, or
presence of downy mildew symptoms is observed in the
vineyard or adjacent vineyard, spray non-systemic
fungicides available as wettable powders (WP) can be
applied as dusting.

25 to 35 days

Downy mildew and anthracnose

Mix fosetyl Al @ 3 g / L in solution of GA prepared for
spray. Normally 2 to 3 sprays of GA are given. Only one of
these sprays, preferably first or second, spray may be given
along with fosetyl Al. Time of spray may be decided
considering, the time of spray of systemic fungicide for
downy mildew given before the start of GA sprays. pH of
spray solution of fosetyl al is acidic and hence helps better
absorption of GA.

However, if wet weather prevails during GA applications,
spray of non-systemic fungicides other than copper
fungicides is given after spray of fosetyl al and /or
subsiquant spray of systemic fungicide is given at 3 days
interval instead of 5 days.

Powdery mildew

If cloudy climate prevails there will be increase in morning
temperature and morning dew may remain for less time.
Under such situation powdery mildew can develop
sporadically in vineyards leading to development of
inoculum.

Spray sulphur 80 WDG @ 2.0g / L.

If the cloudy climate persists for long period one spray of
systemic fungicides recommended for powdery mildew
(Annexure I) may be needed. Fungicide such as flusilazole
has long PHI and is not recommended after fruit set due to
residue problems can be preferred during this period.

35 to 50 days

Downy mildew
It is most deceptive period, as even if there is no much dew

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes

35
Days after Control measure for disease
pruning or growth
stage

in the morning hours, downy mildew may appear only on
bunches, and cause flower drop, or complete destruction of
bunch. Infection on leaves under such situation may be nil
or minimum. About two preventive sprays of systemic
fungicides for the control of downy mildew, at 5 days
interval are essentially needed during this period.

Powdery mildew

Cloudy conditions will start the development of powdery
mildew during this period. As most growers are more
worried about downy mildew infection during this period,
light infections of powdery mildew could be un-noticed.
The worldwide it is observed that if powdery mildew
infection is developed on bunches during flowering to fruit-
set period, it becomes very difficult to control the disease
on bunches during later stages. Especially it could lead to
rachis infection of powdery mildew after veraison stage.
Therefore at least one spray of systemic fungicide for the
control of powdery mildew is needed during flowering
stage.

It is an ideal time for sprays of strabularin fungicides such
as azoxystrobin 233C or kresoxim methyl 44.3 SC, as it
will provide protection against both downy mildew and
powdery mildew.

50 days onwards |Powdery mildew

Ensure that vines do not suffer from potassium deficiency.
In case deficiency is observed give sprays of potassium
nitrates / Potassium sulphate / monopotassium
phosphate, are suggested. Follow the guidelines given
under chapter on nutrient and water management.

Spray any one of the recommended systemic fungicides at
7 to 10 days interval starting immediately after fruit set i.e.
about 50 days of pruning. Spray interval can be decided on
the basis of weather conditions or actual presence or
absence of disease in vineyards.

Whenever powdery mildew infection is seen in vineyard
spray of tank mix of regular dose of systemic fungicide and
potassium bi carbonate 5 kg / ha is useful to eradicate left
over powdery infections.

Between two sprays of systemic fungicides non-systemic
fungicide dinocap 48 EC @ 25 ml/100 lit water can be
sprayed up to 65-70 days after pruning.

Most of the fungicides for the control of powdery mildew
are given after fruit set. To avoid the residue of these
fungicides in berries at harvest, recommended pre harvest
intervals (PHI) and maximum residue levels (MRL) should
be considered while selecting fungicide for spray at
different growth stages. Normally, fungicides with long PHI
and low MRL are selected for spray at early fruit growth

stages. Use of flusilazole should be avoided after fruit set,
while fungicides such as penconazole, and tridemefon
should be selected up to first 80 days of pruning and
hexaconazole or myclobutanil should be preferred close to
veraison stage.

75 to 90 days

Powdery mildew on bunches or rachis

Spray of strabularin fungicides such as azoxystrobin,
which has PHI as low as 7 days, and MRL as high as 2.0
ppm. Hence such fungicide can be used for control of
powdery mildew on bunches during last 30 days of berry
maturity.

Spray of sulphur 80 WDG @ 1.0 to 1.5 g / L can be given
during last 20 to 30 days of berry maturity for the control
of powdery mildew. Such sprays can be given alongwith
good quality spreaders (Silwet or Sure-shot @ 0.05 to 0.1
ml / L) to avoid stains on berries.

If less than 30 days are left application of mineral oils (HP
Grape Spray oil 5 — 7 ml / L) can be used as spray on
bunches for the control of powdery mildew without the risk
of objectionable residue.

Before application of any formulation few days before
harvest it is advised to try the formulation first on few
plants and if any spot or similar abnormality is not seen
on berries the formulation can be used for spraying entire
vineyard.

Insect and mite pest
management

D. S. YADAV
AMALA U.

Grapevines in peninsular India
remain available for the pest
development all the year round which
leads to high pest infestation. Last two
decades of viticulture in India
witnessed sea-change in arthropod
pest scenario. Girdler beetle which
was major pest became minor, and
minor pests such as thrips, mealybug,
and red spider mite became major.
More recently, an outbreak of
leafthopper, Amrasca biguttula
biguttula Ishida which was pest of
only minor importance in grapes, was
reported in Maharashtra state of India
in 2011. Similarly, red spider mite,
Tetranychus urticae has also attained
a serious pest status only after 2006.
Presently, thrips, leafthopper, mealy
bug, stem borer and red spider mite
are very important and cause
considerable damage to the grapes
almost every year. Before taking

decisions on pest management
interventions, the knowledge of
identification characteristics of

different pests and their biology is
very important.

1. Biology
1.1 Thrips

Thrips are the sucking pests
which prefer to feed on the succulent
and juicy tender parts of the vine, like
young growing shoots and appear
after both the prunings. This insect
enjoys the warm, bright sunlight
combined with slightly ~~ higher
temperature and low relative
humidity. It disperses very easily in
the vineyard as they are very active

insects. Mainly two thrips species,
viz., Scirtothrips dorsalis (Figure 1)
and Rhipiphorothrips cruentatus
(Figure 2) cause damage to growing
shoots, flowers and berries of table
grapes in India. A third thrips species,
Retithrips syriacus (Figure 3) is also
reported in grapevine, however, it
remains only on old leaves and does

either to berries, flowers or leaves.
Nymphal stage of Retithrips is reddish
in colour and farmers often confuse it
with red spider mites, therefore,
correct identification is important
(Figure 4). Both nymphs and adults

foundation pruning is mainly confined
to vegetative parts of the vine but after
the fruit pruning, in addition to the
damage on vegetative parts, they also
damage the flowers and young berries.
Thrips suck the sap from the ovaries
of flowers in the berry setting stage,
which leads to flower shedding and
loss in yield. This is the loss in terms
of quantity; however the loss in terms
of quality is also very serious as
rasping and sucking of young berries
by thrips results in the brownish net-

like appearance on the berry surface
as well as scab formation (Figure 6).

1.3 Mealybug

Pink mealybug, Maconellicoccus
hirsutus (Figure 9) is the major
mealybug species infesting grapes in

Fig. 9. Maconellicoccus hirsutus

India. Mealybugs are the major group
of sucking pests affecting the
grapevine. These insects prefer high
temperature and comparatively less
relative humidity. Population of
mealybugs is usually low from June to
November and starts increasing from
mid-December onwards. Both the
adults and nymphs suck the plant
sap from the tender vine parts during
the new flush emergence stage
especially after fruit pruning, which
leads to the curling and malformation
of vine parts and thereby arresting
further growth of the shoot. During
veraison stage, they migrate from the

trunk, cordons and shoots to
developing berries and produce
profuse quantity of honeydew leading
to sooty and sticky bunches (Figure
10) which considerably reduces the

Fig. 10. Mealybug infested bunch

quality and marketability of the fruits.
Ants association with these pests will
further aggravate the problem as they
help the pest to migrate easily from
one vine to another besides protecting
from the natural enemies.

1.4 Flea beetle

Scelodonta strigicollis (Figure
11) is the major species of flea beetle
infesting grapes in India. These are
metallic brown beetles with black
spots on the dorsal side. They are
active especially during the bud
breaking stage of the vine after the
pruning. Adults are damaging stage of
the pest. Adults eat away the young
buds and leaves. As a result the shoot
growth is arrested. Linear and
rectangular shaped holes on the

leaves are the characteristic damage
symptoms by this pest (Figure 12).

Fig. 12. Characteristic linear leaf
damage by flea beetle

Flea beetle grubs are seen in the soil
feeding on the roots but do not cause
economical damage.

1.5 Caterpillar

Caterpillars are biting and
chewing type of insects and are not
very serious pests of grapevine, even

though occasionally they emerge as a
serious pest. During the flowering and
fruiting stage if relative humidity
increases due to rainfall, Spodoptera
ltura (Figure 13) may become a

Fig. 13. Spodoptera litura larva

serious pest. They can be easily
monitored by regular inspection of
vineyards.

1.6 Mite

Tetranychus urticae (Figure 14)
is the major species causing damage
to grapes in India. Mites are important
group of non-insect pest attacking
grapevine. They are also sucking pests
and prefer high temperature and low

Fig. 14. Tetranychus urticae

relative humidity. Their population
starts increasing from second week of
December and reaches to a peak
during February-April. They prefer to
feed on older leaves but increase in
population leads to their migration to
even bunches. Both nymphs and
adults suck the vine sap and weaken
the vine. Serious infestation leads to
extensive defoliation especially during
January to April and reduces the TSS
in the berries and resulting into poor
quality fruits.

1.7 Stem Borer

Stem borer has recently
attained the status of major pest of
grapevine in India.  Stromatium
barbatum (Figure 15) and Celosterna

Hc?
Fig. 15. Stromatium barbatum

scrabrator are the major species
infesting grapevine. These are the
group of pests which can kill the
whole vine compared to other pests in
grapes. Adult emergence coincides
with the onset of monsoon during
May-June. Soon after mating, the
females lay the eggs in the crevices of
bark. After hatching, the grubs bore
into the vine and the remaining part
of their life cycle is completed inside
the vine. In the later stage of

infestation, bore holes and leaves with
interveinal chlorosis can be observed
(Figure 16). More than one borer can

Fig. 16. Interveinal chlorosis

infest single vine and parts like trunk,
cordons and also branches having
more than 1.5-2 cm diameter are
preferred. Bored holes, heaps of
excreta (either in pellet or in powder
form) in and around the vines (Figure
17), general weakness of the vine,

2. Management
2.1 General practices

For insect and mite pest
management, many common
management strategies need to be
followed. Field sanitation like removal
and burning of pruned vine parts,
dried branches, weeds, etc. should be
followed throughout the year in order
to bring down the inoculum of pests.
During off season, pests like
mealybugs hide under the bark of the
vine, under the mulches near the root
zone of the vine, and on the weed
plants like Cyprus sp., Parthenium
etc. Summer ploughing at inter and
intra row spaces of the vine is
recommended to expose the hidden
stages of different pests. Ants help in
the dispersion of mealybugs from one
vine to another. So monitor the
vineyards for ant movement and
manage them.

Regular scouting and
monitoring is necessary to detect early
infestations and to take right
management decisions at right time.
Observe 20 vines/acre randomly on
daily basis.

Chemical sprays should
properly cover both sides of the leaf
especially underside in the case of
mite. In case of mealybugs, the sprays
should be more concentrated towards
the trunks, cordons, young buds and
bunches rather than only on the
foliage. For thrips, whole foliage spray
especially on young shoots, flowers

and bunches gives effective
management.
The details of chemicals

recommended for management of
insect and mite pests with their doses,
pre harvest interval (PHI), maximaum
residue limits (MRL), etc. are given in
Annexure | of this document.

Mealybug

If mealybug infestation is observed on less than 5% of vines,
then spot application, otherwise if infestation is more, whole
vineyard needs to be sprayed. Two sprays of buprofezin 25 SC
(@ 1.25 ml/L at an interval of 10 days are effective.

Thrips and leafhopper

If thrips population is above 3 per shoot, then spraying with
fipronil 80 WG @ 0.05g/L or lambda-cyhalothrin 5 CS @ 0.5
ml/ L or imidacloprid 17.8 SL @0.30 ml/L is effective.

This application will take care of leafhoppers also.
Stem Borer

As the adults are attracted to light, installation of Fine Light
Trap @ 1 trap per hectare helps to trap and kill the adults
especially soon after rain. The traps should be installed atleast
15 feet away from vineyard at three feet above ground level.

During June to[Chaffer beetle

Mealybug

Swabbing/washing of the trunk and cordons with methomyl 40
SP @ 1.0g/L after the bark removal, will help in management of
mealybugs.

Check for the ant movement and manage them.
Caterpillar

Light traps installed for the stem borer will reduce the insect
population by trapping moths. Spodoptera Ltura pheromone
traps @ 6 numbers/ha can also be installed to trap and kill
adult moths.

In case of caterpillar infestation, spray of methomyl 40 SP @ 1
g/L or emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.22 g/L or lambda

Spraying of emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.22 g/L is
effective at this stage for managing thrips if pest population
reaches 2 thrips per bunch or shoot. If active shoot growth
is observed during this period then stop it by shoot tipping.
This practice helps in reducing thrips population in the
vineyard.

Mites
Give adequate irrigation as water stressed vines are more
prone to mite infestation.

In the case of severe infestation, one jet spray of water
before the acaricidal spray will reduce the webbings and
improves efficacy of subsequent spray of acaricide.

Spraying of sulphur 80 WDG @ 1.5-2.0g/L is effective in

Maturity indices,
harvesting and

post-harvest quality
management

A. K. SHARMA
P. G. ADSULE

Harvesting and post-harvest
management practices have prime
importance in maintaining the quality
of table grapes. Harvesting of grapes
at right maturity, gentle handling
during harvesting, sorting, grading
enhance the overall quality and
enable to increase in shelf life and
fetch more price in the market.

1. Maturity indices

Grape being non-climacteric
fruit, it should be harvested after
ripening. The minimum TSS of 16°B
and sugar acid ratio of 20 has been
fixed under the AGMARK as maturity
standards of quality grapes.
Characteristic uniform colour
development is a reliable index of
ripening in coloured varieties. In
white varieties, uniform green colour
is preferred.

2. Harvesting

Only attractive bunches
fulfilling minimum AGMARK quality
requirement should be harvested.
Harvesting should be done by skilled
workers wearing soft rubber gloves
and using sharp secatures / scissors
for cutting.

Careful handling of grapes
during harvesting, transporting,
cleaning and packing is very essential
to prevent injury and abrasion. The
bunch should always be held by
stem/ peduncle. Rough handling
results in loss of bloom (thin wax
coating on berry surface) making the
berries susceptible to decay (Fig 1).

3. Time of harvesting

Bunches should be harvested
during early morning hours before the
berry temperature rises above 20°C,
so that the berry temperature can be
brought down to 4°C by pre-cooling
within four - six hours. In case of dew,
harvesting should be delayed till the
dew has dried. If rainfall has occurred

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 47
the fruit should not be picked for at
least 3-4 days. At harvest, the berries
with visual symptoms of decay and
damage (Fig 2) should be removed.
These grapes should be cold stored
separately and monitored for any
development of decay.

4, Bunch collection

Harvested bunches are placed
gently in clean perforated plastic
crates and left in the shade of the
vines for subsequent transfer to pack-
house. The crates should be lined
with food grade bubble sheets for
cushioning and kept over newspapers
spread on the ground to avoid
contamination with vineyard dust.
The bunches are kept in such a way
that their stalks should not injure
berries of other bunches.

5. Bunch cleaning and
sorting

Trimming to remove immature,
diseased, shrivelled, undersized, off-
colour (Fig 3) or under developed and
uneven sized (Fig 4) berries or side
branches of the rachis should be done
very carefully with sharp long nosed

development of decay causing
organisms. Bunches which are too
compact or too straggly or are
damaged by sun scorching, diseases
and insects should be removed before
grading and packing.

6. Grading

Quality parameters of bunch,
in terms of bunch weight and berry
appearance (shape, colour, visible
traces of moulds, skin blemishes) and
fruit composition parameters like TSS,
acidity and sugar : acid ratio has to
comply AGMARK standards. Food
safety standards like agrochemical
residues in table grapes particularly
the maximum residue limits (MRLs)
are also to be complied as per
regulations.

Detailed quality specifications
are outlined below:

7. Storage
7.1 Pre-cooling

The grapes should be
transported to pre-cooling units
within 4-6 hours of harvest. The
temperature of harvested grapes
should be brought down to less than
4°C within six to eight hours in the
pre-cooling chambers. If the pre-

cooling units are away from the
production sites and packing houses,
mobile pre-cooling units are to be
used. The filled boxes without closing
the polyethylene liner are placed in
the pre-cooling chambers.

7.2 Cold storage

After pre-cooling, the dual
releasing sulphur dioxide pads (Grape
guard) are placed with their coated
surfaces facing downwards on the
filled plastic pouches and covered
with the plastic sheet lining. The
boxes are closed and shifted to cold
storage rooms where the temperature
and humidity are maintained at 0 +
0.5°C and 93 + 2% respectively.
Temperature of 0°C and humidity of
95% are the best for maintaining
freshness and preventing decay.

8. Transport

Conveyances and/or containers
used for transporting food stuffs shall
be kept clean and maintained in good
conditions in order to protect
foodstuffs from contamination and
dust. These containers must be
capable of maintaining appropriate
temperatures which should be
monitored at regular intervals.

Safe use of
agrochemicals

KAUSHIK BANERJEE
AHAMMED SHABEER T.P.
GOVIND HANDE

Agrochemicals are basically
organic or inorganic compounds
which degrade with time to non-toxic
metabolites on exposure to physio-
chemical factors e.g. sunlight, heat,
humidity, chemical agents in
atmosphere, etc., and biological
factors viz. enzymes, microbes, etc.

1. Sources of agrochemical
residues in table grapes

In table grapes, the
agrochemical residues may appear
from the following sources:

1.1 Direct Source:

When agrochemicals are
applied directly on the plants, a
fraction of it gets adsorbed on the
surface or absorbed by the fruits. The
time required for degradation of a
toxic molecule to harmless
metabolites may vary from hours to
years depending on the chemical
nature of the compound and its
susceptibility to the degrading factors.
If a crop is harvested before such
period, then analysis of the samples
results in detection of the residues
and consumption of such
contaminated food may result in acute
toxicity.

1.2 Indirect source:

Spray drift from adjoining crop
fields, contaminated soil and
irrigation water, contaminated agro-
inputs like manures, fertilizers etc.
can be source of pesticide residue.

2. Maximum residue limit
(MRL) and its
relationship with the
GAP

MRL is the legally permitted
maximum concentration of the
pesticide residues in or on food when
offered for consumption. It is derived
by taking into account good
agricultural practices (GAP). MRLs are
the trade standards that are set in a
way that there are no concerns for
public health, especially with regard
to vulnerable subpopulation groups
(as children and the unborn). GAP
takes into account the application of
minimum quantities of pesticides
necessary to achieve adequate pest
control in such a manner that the
amount of residues in the food is
smallest possible. At the international
level, the Codex Alimentarius
Commission of the FAO/WHO decides
MRL. The Codex Committee on
pesticide residues (CCPR) was formed
by United Nations with primary
mandate to establish MRL for
pesticides in food. In India, the MRL of
pesticide are prescribed under the
Food Safety Act, 2006. MRL of
pesticides are specific for crop or food
item.

Although the Codex MRLs are
applicable to all the nations,
individual countries may have their
own MRL regulations. For agro-export,
it is thus essential that the
commodities should comply with the
latest MRL regulations of the
importing country. For example, the
MRLs set by the European Union (EU)
have to be complied for export of the
fruits and vegetables to any EU
member country. Earlier, individual
EU countries used to have their own
MRLs. Since September 2008, the
MRLs have been harmonized across
the 27 member countries of the
European Union.

Terminal residue load of an
agrochemical in grape or any other

Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes 51
commodity mainly depends upon its
environment-stability and dissipation
pattern. The rate of dissipation again
largely depends upon the amount and
concentration applied, initial deposit
and the prevailing environmental
conditions during fruit development
stage.

The knowledge on MRL acts as
a valuable guide to the growers and
phyto-sanitary certificate issuing
authorities of the Government. It
alarms a grower for the fact that if he
does not follow the recommended
package of practices, the terminal
residue levels of pesticides may exceed
the permissible MRLs and he might
face marketing set back along with
legal hazards. The regulatory bodies
at the National and International
levels may use this information to
decide whether a commodity is fit for
sale in domestic and international
markets.

3. Pre-harvest interval

It is the concept to minimize
pesticide residues. On the basis of the
MRL, the pre-harvest intervals (PHI) of
pesticides are calculated. PHI is the
safe waiting period, which is the
minimum time in days that must be
provided between last application of a
pesticide and harvesting of the
produce so that its residue level at
harvest reaches below the MRL.
Estimating PHI of a pesticide ideally
involves multi-location field trails
wherein the pesticides are applied
following the guidelines of GAP.
Representative samples are collected
from the treated plants and analysed
for the residues. The sampling is
initiated on the day of the final
application and continued at regular
time interval till harvest. After precise
estimation of the residues in each
sample, the residue data are
statistically processed to correlate the
dissipation with progress of time. The
dissipation rate is faster at the
beginning and gets slowed down with
the passage of time. This indicates a

non-linear pattern of degradation and
often implies that simple first order
kinetics might not be adequate to
explain the dissipation behaviour of
most of the pesticides and predict the
PHI.

Note

All the doses mentioned above are for high volume sprayers, where normal spray volume is
1000 L/ha. Spray volume can however be changed as per the efficiency of sprayers used.
However, the amount of each pesticide based on its active ingredient recommended for 1 ha
area on the basis of 1000 L spray solution should be strictly maintained to minimize pesticide

residues.

56 Good Agricultural Practices for Production of Quality Table Grapes

Recommended PHI will be valid only if two applications of an agrochemical are given per
fruiting season at the interval of 7-15 days at recommended dose except in case of Flusilazole
and Methomyl.

The PHI of the fungicide Flusilazole and insecticide Methomyl pertains to one application by
foliar spray only.

Imidacloprid (17.8 SL) application (spraying or soil drenching) should not exceed more than
two times per fruiting season.

The responsibility of usage of chemicals for the management of any of the above pests and
diseases will rest with the growers in compliance with the requirements of the importers / EU
and, in the minimum; all chemicals listed in Annexure 9 should be tested.
